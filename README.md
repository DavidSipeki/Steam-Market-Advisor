# Steam-Market-Advisor

This program helps you exploit the inconsistency in item pricing on the Steam market and the community market

## How it works
- You buy a Mann Co. Key on the Steam market with real money
- The program suggests what other in-game item you should trade that Key for
- You sell the traded item on the Steam market at a profit

## Setup
### Required
- Request an API key from https://backpack.tf/developer
- After receiving one, open up run.py in an editor
- Paste your key like: APIKEY = "yourapikey"
### Additional
- It is also recommended to set the price varaibles
- The sample input files work quite well, but they can also be edited
